## 📌 Overview

The **QuizGame** is a terminal-based interactive quiz designed to test general knowledge. It offers:

* Multiple-choice questions with 4 options each.
* Immediate feedback on answers.
* A manual hint after the first wrong attempt.
* An AI-powered correct answer reveal after the second wrong attempt.

The AI integration uses Google’s Gemini language model to generate helpful feedback, improving user learning without giving away answers too soon.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The game starts with a welcome message and a sequence of questions.
2. Each question is displayed with four answer options (a, b, c, d).
3. The user inputs their choice.
4. If the answer is correct:

   * A “Correct!” message is shown and the score increases.
5. If the answer is incorrect:

   * On the **first incorrect attempt**, the game provides a **manual hint** (a helpful clue related to the question).
   * On the **second incorrect attempt**, the game calls the **AI (Gemini)** to generate and display the **correct answer**.
6. This process repeats for all questions.
7. At the end, the final score and a performance message are displayed.

## 🤖 AI Integration Details

* The AI is triggered only on the second incorrect attempt for a question.
* It uses the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model via Jac’s AI integration feature.
* The correct answer is passed as a prompt to the AI to generate a helpful response like:

  ```
  ✅ Correct answer: a
  ```
* This keeps the game engaging and provides users with intelligent feedback.
